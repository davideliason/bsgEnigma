	      <h3><a href="./just_who_is_starbuck.html">Starbuck As Angel?</a></h3>
	      <p>Starbuck dies when she flies into the wormhole. Later, however, she re-appears to many members of the BSG crew, and actually visits her own corpse!. The question is raised as to what or who Starbuck actually was - was she re-animated somehow, was she an angel, or a mass hallucination?</p>

	      <h3>Robots becoming self-aware/alive</h3>
	      <p>The cyclons were machines that humans creating, but at some point, they became self-aware, and apart from their mechanical bodies, undistinguishable from humans. They even became very interested in spirituality, and the state of their "souls." What then is a soul, what does it mean to be 'alive'?</p>

	      <h3>The Hybrid Baby</h3>        
	      <p>Sharon, a cylon, has a baby with a BSG officer, and the baby actually grows and flourishes! If we unpackage that, that means that human genetics and cylon genetics were able to correlate and reproduce, which is pretty astounding, not to mention that somehow a cylon, originally a machine, was able to contribute to the genetic union. The lines between robot and human are therefore very much blurred, not just in a consciousness aspect but physically.</p>
